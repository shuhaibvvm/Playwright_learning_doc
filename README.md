### 🚫 Prohibited Uses

**DO NOT** use this project or its techniques for:
- Bypassing security measures on websites without permission
- Violating website terms of service or robots.txt directives
- Scraping personal, private, or sensitive data
- Commercial scraping that harms website performance or business
- Any activity that violates local, national, or international laws

### 📋 Responsible Scraping Guidelines

Before scraping any website:
1. **Check robots.txt** - Always respect the website's robots.txt file
2. **Review Terms of Service** - Ensure your use case is permitted
3. **Request Permission** - Contact website owners for commercial use
4. **Rate Limiting** - Implement reasonable delays to avoid overwhelming servers
5. **Data Privacy** - Respect user privacy and data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
6. **Attribution** - Give proper credit when using scraped data

### ⚖️ Legal Responsibility

Users of this project are solely responsible for ensuring their scraping activities comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The authors and contributors of this project disclaim any liability for misuse of the provided tools and techniques.

**Remember**: Just because you *can* bypass anti-bot measures doesn't mean you *should*. Always prioritize ethical and legal practices.
