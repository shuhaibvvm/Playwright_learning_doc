## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Legal and Ethical Use Only

This project is designed purely for educational purposes and legitimate web scraping activities. The techniques and bypass methods demonstrated here must only be used for:

- **Educational Learning**: Deepening understanding of web scraping concepts and technologies.
- **Authorized Testing**: Scraping websites you own or have obtained explicit, written permission to scrape.
- **Research Purposes**: Conducting academic or professional research with proper authorization and ethical considerations.
- **Public Data**: Accessing publicly available data that explicitly does not violate terms of service or privacy regulations.

## 🚫 Prohibited Uses

DO NOT use this project or its techniques for:

- Bypassing security measures on websites without express, prior permission.
- Violating website terms of service (ToS) or robots.txt directives.

- Any activity that violates local, national, or international laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 📋 Responsible Scraping Guidelines

Before initiating any scraping activity, always:

1. **Check robots.txt**: Adhere strictly to the website's robots.txt file, which specifies rules for crawlers and bots.
2. **Review Terms of Service (ToS)**: Ensure your intended use case is explicitly permitted by the website's ToS.
3. **Request Permission**: For commercial or large-scale data collection, always contact website owners to request explicit permission.
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Introduce reasonable delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers and being perceived as malicious activity (e.g., time.sleep()).
5. **Respect Data Privacy**: Comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
6. **Provide Attribution**: When utilizing scraped data in public work, provide proper credit to the data source.

## ⚖️ Legal Responsibility

Users of this project are solely responsible for ensuring their scraping activities comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The authors and contributors of this project disclaim any liability for the misuse of the provided tools and techniques.

**Remember**: The ability to bypass anti-bot measures does not confer permission to do so. Always prioritize ethical and legal practices.

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Basic Product Scraper
This example demonstrates a fundamental Playwright scraper.

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
import json
from datetime import datetime

async def scrape_product(url):
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False) # Set headless=True for production
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto(url, wait_until='networkidle') # Wait until network is idle

        # Enhanced selectors for robustness
        title = await page.text_content('h1.product-title, .product-name-heading')
        price = await page.text_content('.price-display, span[itemprop="price"]')
        
        # Example of extracting an attribute
        image_url = await page.get_attribute('img.product-image', 'src')
        
        await browser.close()
        return {'title': title, 'price': price, 'image_url': image_url, 'scraped_at': datetime.now().isoformat()}

# Run the scraper
async def main():
    result = await scrape_product('https://example-store.com/product') # Replace with a real URL
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🚨 Best Practices

### Anti-Detection (Use Responsibly & Ethically)
- **Realistic Delays**: Always implement dynamic and realistic delays (`time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 5))`) between requests to avoid triggering rate limits.
- **Rotate User Agents and Headers**: Utilize a pool of diverse user-agents and emulate realistic request headers (e.g., Accept, Accept-Encoding, Referer).
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Gracefully handle HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx), network issues, and unexpected page structures. Implement intelligent retry logic.
- **Respect robots.txt and ToS**: Always verify and adhere to the website's policies.
- **Rate Limiting**: Never overwhelm servers. Monitor response times and server load, adjusting request frequency accordingly.

### Data Quality
- **Validate All Extracted Data**: Implement schema validation and data type checks for all scraped fields.
- **Multiple Selector Fallbacks**: Provide alternative selectors for critical elements to ensure resilience against minor website layout changes.
- **Handle Edge Cases**: Account for missing data, None values, and unexpected content structures.
- **Clean and Normalize Data**: Standardize units (e.g., currencies, dimensions), remove extraneous characters, and ensure data consistency.

### Professional Development
- **Write Comprehensive Tests**: Develop unit and integration tests for your scraping logic and data processing components.
- **Document Code Thoroughly**: Provide clear comments, docstrings, and a README.md for maintainability and collaboration.
- **Utilize Structured Logging**: Implement a logging framework (e.g., Python's logging module) to track scraper activity, errors, and performance metrics.
- **Implement Graceful Error Recovery**: Design your scrapers to recover from failures without crashing, potentially by retrying, skipping, or logging errors for manual review.
